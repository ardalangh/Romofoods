            <DetailPageTypography>Our 'Pistachio Pesto with Cashews & Pine Nuts' is a blend of all-natural ingredients
                without any
                added preservatives and/or flavorings.
                Our sauce consists of California pistachios, cashews, pine nuts, and extra aged Parmesan cheese to give
                it a unique taste and a premium flavor profile.
                This combination is accompanied by other highly nutritious ingredients such as: fresh basil, fresh
                garlic, single-origin extra virgin olive oil, and high-oleic sunflower oil.</DetailPageTypography>


            <DetailPageTypography>The (rBST-free) milk for our cheeses is sourced from local farms of Green Bay, WI
                where animals
                are treated with respect and care.
                Our recipe has been tweaked many times to create a sauce that is pleasant, healthy, balanced, and full
                of clean energy.</DetailPageTypography>


            <DetailPageTypography>Ingredients: Fresh Basil, Single-Origin Extra Virgin Olive Oil*, High-Oleic Sunflower
                Oil*,
                Extra-Aged Parmesan Cheese, Pistachio, Cashew, Pine Nut, Fresh Garlic, Romano Cheese, Sea Salt
            </DetailPageTypography>

            <DetailPageTypography>*Please note that we are using moderate amounts of salt and oil to make our pesto an
                easier pick for
                everyone. You could always add salt and/or olive oil to your desire. Please enjoy!

                a recommendation: When using our sauce, it is best enjoyed in its original state. Cooking the sauce
                changes the flavor profile of our pesto. For example, use it as a spread on top of your pizza and
                don't cook it in the oven. That's all :)

                Ã›pdates: We're in the process of reducing our packaging size from 8 to 6 ounces. This decision was
                made to help with having the freshest pesto on the shelves, and to reduce the price while keeping
                our quality as excellent as ever ðŸŽ‰ Please send us your thoughts at the bottom of this page. We
                would ðŸ’š to hear from you.
